Go K8s Security Lab Management Map

This map will help you keep track of the commands we've added to the Makefile.

1. When You've Changed Code (Go or HTML)
   make run    - Builds a new image, stops the old one, and runs the fresh container
   make test   - Checks that the API responds and the server is alive

2. When It's Time to Check Security
   make scan-strict       - Most important command. Fails if security vulnerabilities found
   make scan-manifests    - Checks Kubernetes configurations for security issues
   make security-pipeline - Runs all security checks in one command

3. When It's Time to Deploy to Kubernetes
   make push         - Sends verified image to GitHub Packages (GHCR)
   make k8s-deploy   - Creates namespace in cluster and deploys server
   make k8s-access   - Sets up tunnel to access website from cluster

4. When You Need to Test Protection in Real Time
   make netpol-apply        - Applies network firewall rules inside Kubernetes
   make policy-test         - Tests network policies by simulating attack attempts
   make falco-install-clean - Installs Falco runtime security monitoring

Tip: Use 'make help' for detailed command descriptions.
